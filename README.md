# Sales Decline Analysis

Data-driven analysis of sales decline across regions, customer types, and sales channels using Python and Power BI.

---

## Project Overview
This project investigates the decline in sales across different regions, customer segments, and sales channels. Python is used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, while Power BI creates an interactive dashboard for actionable insights.

---

## Business Questions
- Which regions and customer types contribute most to sales decline?  
- Are returning or new customers driving the decline?  
- How do online and offline sales channels compare during the decline?

---

## Dataset
- [Raw Data](data/sales_decline_dataset.csv) – original sales dataset  
- [Cleaned Data](data/sales_cleaned_for_powerbi.csv) – preprocessed for Power BI

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **Power BI Desktop**: Interactive dashboards

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and feature engineering  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Export cleaned data for Power BI  
5. Interactive dashboard creation

---

## Key Insights
- Sales decline is driven mainly by specific regions.  
- Returning customers show stronger decline than new customers.  
- Online sales are more stable than offline sales.

---

## Recommendations
- Focus on boosting sales in underperforming regions.  
- Develop strategies to retain returning customers.  
- Monitor offline sales performance and optimize operational processes.

---

## Dashboards & Visualizations
- KPI cards: Total Sales, Orders, Average Order Value  
- Monthly sales trend  
- Sales by region, customer type, and channel  
- Interactive slicers

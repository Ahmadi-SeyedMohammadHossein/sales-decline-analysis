# Sales Decline Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales decline across regions, customer types, and sales channels to identify key business drivers and support data-driven decision-making.
Python is used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and Power BI is used to build an interactive dashboard.

## Business Questions
- Which regions contribute most to the sales decline?
- Are returning customers or new customers more affected?
- Which sales channels are more stable over time?

## Dataset
- `data/sales_decline_dataset.csv` – raw sales data
- `data/sales_cleaned_for_powerbi.csv` – cleaned dataset prepared using Python

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI Desktop

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and feature engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Export cleaned data for Power BI
5. Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI

## Key Insights
- Sales decline is primarily driven by specific regions
- Returning customers show a stronger decline than new customers
- Online sales channels are more stable compared to offline channels

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:
- KPI cards (Total Sales, Orders, Average Order Value)
- Monthly sales trend
- Sales by region
- Sales by customer type
- Sales by channel
- Interactive slicers

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/` – Python analysis (Jupyter Notebook)
- `media/` – demo video of Python analysis and Power BI dashboard

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook
3. Install required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
